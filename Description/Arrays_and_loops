# Arrays represtent list of values
* We can type push() to add value at the end of the array and splice() remove value from an array

# Next we can put while loop, it will keep running (make iterations) while the condition is true
* And it create scope, so variable that we create between the brackets only exist inside
* We can also use for loop which takes shorter form and we for loop through all array

# The we use accumulator pattern, it accumulate the result, in accumulate variable
* We first create variable to store result and we loop through the array and update the result

# We want to take html that we created using loop and put it into the <div> element
* Everytime we add todo to the list we are gonna display the list again

# Next i gonna add delete button, i create it inside renderTodoList, in paragraph
* Next i do delete button clickable and remove todo from the list using .splice() and pass the index

# And next i gonna create do date feature, it will allow me to set a date for a task
* First i make <input> element with date type
* Our todoList is gonna be not array of strings, but an object with name and dueDate
* We take name and dueDate from todoObject, which is our list of indexes and now insert name and dueData
