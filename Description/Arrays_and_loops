# Arrays represtent list of values
* We can type push() to add value at the end of the array and splice() remove value from an array

# Next we can put while loop, it will keep running (make iterations) while the condition is true
* And it create scope, so variable that we create between the brackets only exist inside
* We can also use for loop which takes shorter form and we for loop through all array

# The we use accumulator pattern, it accumulate the result, in accumulate variable
